<!-- 1. So HTML stands for hypertext markup language and the really important part here is the word markup
because there's many markup languages. For example,you might have heard of things such as XML, extensible 
markup language,or GML, generalized markup language.And all of these languages share a common history. 
They're based off the markup that used to be put into manuscripts where editors would mock up the 
manuscript and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the publishers.
So for example,you might have the squiggly line that shows the publishers that this part should
be printed in bold,or this part should be printed in italics. And HTML works in much the same way.-->

<!-- 2. hypertext part of HTML.So hypertext is basically just a bunch of text documents
that can be linked together using these hyperlinks. So when you click on one of them,
it takes you to a different text document,-->

<!-- 3. It's easy to use HTML to open a link in a new tab. You just need an anchor (<a>) 
element with three important attributes:
    1. The href attribute set to the URL of the page you want to link to
    2. The target attribute set to _blank, which tells the browser to open the link in a new tab/window, depending on the browser's settings
    3. The rel attribute set to noreferrer noopener to prevent possible malicious attacks from the pages you link to-->
